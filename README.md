# AutoGDriveUploader

yeah I don't like the name either, but it's what the program is meant to do.

This project came out of the necessity of storing large amounts of video files that are easily accumulated when running a youtube channel.

It is simple but not very well written, I was in a hurry.. But it works And does what I need.

## What it does

Basically you point it at some directories and it syncs the files in yout filesystem with your google drive.

Then you can safely delete it locally and fre up some space knowing it is backed up with the same file structure as when it was uploaded. Dope!

## Current State

You have to set the directory you want it to point at in the main.py and the run it `python3 main.py` (obviously gonna improve on that)

## Future Work

I'll add a web GUI to this and make a second video about it, I think that will make the project actually pretty useful.

It will run on startup so you don't have to worry much about getting it to sync your files.

The GUI will be accessible through the browser so you know what the current upload state is at any time.

## Youtube

I've shared some of the dev eperience on this in a funny video on youtube: https://youtu.be/eYi1dGhbx_U
